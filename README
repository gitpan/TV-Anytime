NAME
    TV::Anytime - Parse TV-AnyTime bundles of TV and Radio listings

SYNOPSIS
      use TV::Anytime;
      my $tv = TV::Anytime->new("data/20050701/");

      # Find out what services are available
      my @services = $tv->services;
      my @radio_services = $tv->services_radio;
      my @tv_services = $tv->services_television;

DESCRIPTION
    The TV::Anytime module parses TV-Anytime bundles. TV-Anytime is a format
    organised by the TV-Anytime Forum (<http://www.tv-anytime.org/>). These
    are open standards (see ETSI TS102822) for the rich description of
    Radio, Television and other types of media. The metadata specification
    includes a comprehensive genre scheme, methods of linking and grouping
    programmes, listing credits and lots of other data fields.

    This module is concerned with parsing TV-Anytime files that are shipped
    by the British Broadcasting Corporation from
    <http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/feeds/tvradio/doc.html>. It is assumed that
    you have downloaded a .tar.gz from this site and have unpacked it.

METHODS
  new()
    The new() method is the constructor. It takes the directory into which
    you have unpacked the TV-Anytime files:

      my $tv = TV::Anytime->new("data/20050701/");

  services
    The services() method returns a list of all the available services as a
    list of TV::Anytime::Service objects:

      my @services = $tv->services;
  
  services_radio
    The services_radio() method returns a list of the available radio
    services as a list of TV::Anytime::Service objects:

      my @radio_services = $tv->services_radio;

  services_television
    The serviices_television() method returns a list of all the available
    television services as a list of TV::Anytime::Service objects:

      my @tv_services = $tv->services_television;
